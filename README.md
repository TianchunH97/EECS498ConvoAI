# EECS498 Conversational AI - Travel Agent

## TODO
### Clinc:
1. Test Clinc classification and slot mapping
### Backend:
1. Use dynamic slot mapper in business logic to map destinations
2. Debug recommendation by looking at firebase, find reason for "out of index"
3. Say "Remove this place" to remove
(4. Recommend nearby restaurant/hotel based on route)
(5. Recommend according to user preference)
### UI:
#### Itinerary:
1. Enable route guide for multiple days (now we only show the first day guide)
2. Display the destination names on map (now there're only names generated by mapbox at the beginning and end point)
3. Display destination information at resolve_destination_info 
   e.g. "Tell me about Michigan Stadium" -> show photo and introduction on screen
4. Make route map pop up after saying "generate schedule" (now we need to click "generate" to view)
#### General
5. When clicking button, send request to clinc so that there's speakable response
   e.g. User clicks button to add, AI says "xxx has been added..."
### TTS&STT:
(1. Can user directly speak to AI without clicking 'record' button?)


## Notes:
1. Business Transition
- With out BT, user input -> clinc intent classification -> clinc slot extraction -> backend resolve state and slots
- With BT, user input -> clinc intent classification -> clinc slot extraction -> Business logic server BT -> clinc slot extraction based on the new state with the old query -> backend can't resolve slot?
